# ANUGA Clinic 2018
Repository to contain the material for the 2018 CSDMS ANUGA Clinic

At present the clinic is composed of 2 jupyter notebooks:

* [Notebook 1: Introduction to ANUGA](notebooks/notebook1.ipynb)
  - Here we introduce the idea of creating a `domain` which contains the mesh and quantities needed to run the simulation, and encapsulates the methods for setting up the initial conditions, the boundary conditions and the method for evolving the solution. 

* [Notebook 2: Merewether Case Study](notebooks/notebook2.ipynb)

Plans for:

* Notebook 3: Create a simple erosion Operator

## Colaboratory

These notebooks have been designed to run in the google `colaboratory` environment, which provides a jupyter notebook environment running on a virtual machine on the cloud. To use this environment you need a google account so that your notebook can be saved on google drive. 

To start interacting with the notebooks follow the `View in Colaboratory` at the top of each notebook. This will start up a virtual environment associated with your google account where you can run the code in the notebook (and save any changes you might make).
